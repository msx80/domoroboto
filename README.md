# Domoroboto
A web interface for MQTT-based domotic systems.

You provide a json based configuration file describing your device(s) and it generates a "pretty" interface, served with an internal webserver, and lets you send mqtt commands to control the device and captures responses.

It turns this:

```json
	{
		"id": "aria_studio",
		"label": "Aria Studio ðŸ’»",
		"kind": "Daikin A/C",
		"statusTopic": "tele/Plutone/LWT",
		"commandTopic": "cmnd/Plutone/DaikinCtrl",
		"replyTopic": "stat/Plutone/RESULT",
		"activeTopic": "tele/Plutone/SENSOR",
		"activeTopicPath": "$.active",

		"attributes": [
			{ "id": "active", "label": "Active", "desc": "bla", "type":"switch", "defaultValue":false },
			{ "id": "mode", "label":"Mode", "type":"enumeration", "defaultValue":"COOL", "possibleValues": ["FAN", "COOL", "HEAT", "DRY", "AUTO"] },
			{ "id": "fan", "label":"Fan", "type":"enumeration", "defaultValue":"1", "possibleValues": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "NIGHT", "AUTO"] },
			{ "id": "temperature", "label":"Temperature", "type":"temperature", "defaultValue":21, "minValue": 18, "maxValue":30  },
			{ "id": "swingV", "label": "Swing Vert.", "type":"switch", "defaultValue": false },
			{ "id": "swingH", "label": "Swing Horiz.", "type":"switch", "defaultValue": false }
		],
		"commandTemplate": "{ 'active':{{active}}, 'mode':'{{mode}}', 'fan':'{{fan}}', 'temperature':{{temperature}}, 'swingH':false, 'swingV':false }",
		"resultOk": "*\"DaikinCtrl\":\"Done\"*"
	}
	
```

which can send messages like this:

```json
{"mode":"DRY","swingH":false,"fan":"3","swingV":false,"temperature":21,"active":false}
```

Also supports some rudimentary sensor reading and logging.

# Building or downloading

Build with maven: `mvn install assembly:single`, on `target` look for `domoroboto-*-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

Latest build can be downloaded by clicking on the latest Action run [here](https://github.com/msx80/domoroboto/actions).

# Configuration

on [domoroboto.conf](blob/main/domoroboto.conf) you configure:
- your mqtt coordinates and account
- the tcp port for http requests
- user accounts (currently the password is plaintext)

â€‹
on [things.json](things.json) you define your things. There are 4 mqtt topic involved:

- `statusTopic`: this is the typical last will and testament, it expects ONLINE or OFFLINE
- `commandTopic`: this is where the command is sent when the user issue a command
- `replyTopic`: this is where a reply is expected after a command is sent.
- `activeTopic`: this is where domoroboto check if the device is "active", that is, turned on, to show a "light up" icon (green circle). `activeTopicPath` lets you enter a jsonpath to extract the information. These two are optional.

`attributes` is an array of object defining the attributes of the device. Each time a command is issued all the attributes are available to be packed in the command. Allowed types are in [defined here](src/main/java/com/github/msx80/domoroboto/model/Type.java).

To declare how to generate the command, you can specify either:
- `"commandJson": true`, in this case the command is generated as a json message with all attributes and their values
- `"commandTemplate": ".."` in this case the command is a handlebar template where {{attr}} is substituted with the value of attribute "attr".

To parse the reply, a `resultOk` pattern has to be provided, which can use unix-like wildcard (*, ? etc). If the reply received on replyTopic match the pattern, it is considered OK, otherwise the reply is shown to the user as an error.

If the thing has a single switch, an `"autosend": true` attribute can be used, in this case no "Send" button is generated and the switch automatically send the message (saves a click).

Sensors can be configured in `sensors.json`, which should be self explanatory.

# Running

Run the program with `java -jar domoroboto.jar` (requires java 17). You should be able to see the pages at:

http://localhost:8080/baseurl/things

http://localhost:8080/baseurl/sensors

Single things can be linked with the thing id like this: http://localhost:8080/baseurl/things/thing-id
